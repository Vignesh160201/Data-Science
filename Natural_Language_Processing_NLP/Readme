Sentiment Analysis for E-Commerce
Scenario: An e-commerce platform wants to understand customer sentiments from product reviews to enhance user experience and improve product offerings.
Objective: Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
Data: Collect reviews from the website, focusing on text data along with metadata (ratings, timestamps).
Challenges: Handling sarcasm, managing domain-specific vocabulary, and addressing language variations (e.g., slang).
Implementation: Use a combination of pre-trained models (like BERT) and fine-tune them on the collected review dataset.
Evaluation: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance. Additionally, implement A/B testing to evaluate user engagement based on sentiment insights.
